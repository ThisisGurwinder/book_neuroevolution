The encoding of genotype itself can either be direct, or indirect. A direct coding is one in which the genotype encodes every topological
and parametric aspect of the NN phenotype in one to one manner, the genotype and phenotype can be considered one and the same.An indirect
encoding applies a set of program, or functions of genotype, through which phenotype is developed.The development process can be highly
complex and stochasitc in nature which takes into consideration environmental factors during the time of development, and producing a one too
many mapping from a genotype to phenotype.An example of direct coding is that of a bit string which maps to a colored strip in which 0s are
directly converted to white sections and 1s to black.An example of indirect coding is example of DNA, where the development from genotype to
phenotype is multi-staged process, with complex interactions between the developing organism and environment it is in.
